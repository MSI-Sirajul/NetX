<h2 align="center">How It Works</h2>

<p align="justify">

NetX continuously monitors the network traffic and calculates the real-time upload and download speed. The floating overlay displays speed in a compact dynamic icon, while the persistent notification provides a detailed breakdown of network usage. Data usage is stored separately for Wi-Fi and Mobile networks, so you always know how much you’ve consumed.
